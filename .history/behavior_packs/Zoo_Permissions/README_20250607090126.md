## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Access Denied" Messages:**
- Check your permission level with `!myperms`
- Contact staff if you believe you should have higher permissions
- Ensure you're in the correct area for your permission level

**Items Being Removed:**
- This is normal security behavior for restricted items
- Your permission level determines which items you can use
- Contact staff if you need access to specific tools

**Cannot Build/Break Blocks:**
- Verify you have builder+ permissions
- Check if you're in a restricted area
- Builders cannot break existing structures (by design)

**Commands Not Working:**
- Use `!help` to see available commands for your level
- Check command syntax carefully
- Some commands require specific permission levels
