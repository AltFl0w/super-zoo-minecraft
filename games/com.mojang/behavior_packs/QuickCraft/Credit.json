Note: Hey everyone, I’ve used a few builds from the ‘Buildings for Minecraft PE’ app. The builds are meant to be free to use, but I still want to give credit to the creator I downloaded them from.
However, I’m not sure if the builds were originally made by that creator or someone else. So, if you are the original creator of any of the builds I’ve used, feel free to message me on Discord (youtube_dantegaming).
I’ll be more than happy to give you the credit you truly deserve. Thanks.
